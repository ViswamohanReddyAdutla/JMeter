So in webtours application click on Administration linka and then select third option "Set Login form action to error page"  so it will
thrown session id in hidden mode. But i have not installed webtours hence i am trying in another application but it is not good application 
to show you the correlation concepts hence i am writing description manually.

1.Create a thread group and record script
2.Rename Thread group name to coorelation
3.copy/paste all samples inside of that coorelation
4.Now execute the script but it is not getting passed those in listners it is saying all are passed but as per response it is not passed
  successfuly.
5.But if you pass same samplers under the thread group then those steps working perfectly.
6.Bcz here we have maintained all our samplers under the coorelation not thread group.
7.Here i have disabled main Threadgroup and enabled only correlation part.
7.In next file 23.correlation_2.txt file will identify correlation and analysing it.
