Jmeter is a tool it will help us to do performance testing.

Jmeter is developed in java language hence java is required to install in machine.
We have number of test tools but usage of jmeter is rapidly growing due to below reasons.
 1.Open Source (No need to pay).
 2.Cross platform (It will work in all windows formats).
 3.Scripting knowledge is not required to learn JMeter.
