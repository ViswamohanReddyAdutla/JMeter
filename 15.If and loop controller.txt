1.If controller:
  If controller is used to control the execution of the sampler/controller inside of this loop is based on the condition.
2.If condition is not satisfied then it will skip that sampler/controller.
3.After creating samples/controllers inside of this controller just select if loop controller then it will ask you for the condition where we need to pass the condition according
  to business logic.
4.We can use variables in jmeters like below
  click on test plan -> click on Add button -> then under name section you have to pass variable name and under value need to pass value of that variable.
    example :
       my_var    10
5.Once variable creation is done, we can pass that variable in if condition if you want.
   "${my_var}" > "5"
6.While creating variable i have passed value of that variable as 10 and in if loop controller we have compared wheather our variable value is greater than or not
  if our variable is greater than given value in condition then it will execute wheaterver the controllers/samplers inside of this controllers. else it will skip those.
7.Loop controller:
  Loop controller is same like runtime controller where it will take how many seconds particular sampler/controller will execute where as Loop controller will loop the
  particular sampler/controller based on our input
8.If we give loop count as 3 then it will loop particular sampler/controller three times.
