1.As of last file, we have created two regular expression extractor to fetch user id and password that is acceptable but still we can reduce that to one extractor, follow below process 
  to achieve it.
2.Everything is same for script point of view, now you just have to create one regualr expression extractor and the below process.
3.In the field of Regular expression extractor, I have passed below text
   Enter <em>(.+?)</em> for the username and <em>(.+?)</em> for the password.
     Here i have amintained two groups one is for username and other is for password
     but i have created variable for only username and also all step are same as per last script
4.Lets run see the response body content in debuger file where i am able to see username and password with different variable names
5.SO i can pass this variable names directly as part of values to those fields, job done within a single extarctor we have extracted both username and password seamlessly.
6.We can also apply assertions for script validation
