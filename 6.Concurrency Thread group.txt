Concurrency Thread Group :

1.Now i am creating test script under concuurency thread group.
2.We need to create test script under concurrency thread group, below is the process
  a) Select total cincurrency that is total users you need to run here i am giving 60
  b) We need to maintain all users on the server that time we need to start here i am giving 20
      a) so users is 60 and ramp up time is 20 means it will take all given users 60 from 0 to 20 seconds bcz all users wont start 
         application on a same time in real time so ramp up time used to do that like real time
  c) Ramp up step count : Here we need to give some value in my case value is three
      my total users are 60
      Ramp up time is 20 seconds
      Ramp up step count is 3 seconds
        means it will divide all users into three stages and within 20 seconds all three stages users are going to be on the server
           60/3 = 20, Each stage has 20 users
           20/3 = 6.6666, for each 6.6666 seconds those users are up and they will be on the server.
  d) Hold Target time : After 20 seconds all users are on the server and now how many seconds we need to hold them on the server is called
                        as hold target time, in my case it is 150.
  e) Note : Hold target time will be counted from after all users are on the server means after 20 seconds all users on the server and 
            hold target time is 150 so total it is 20+150=170 seconds.
  f) Based on the values that we are passing in concurrency thread group graph may vary, as it is visual representation of the values that
     we given.
  g) If we want to disbale any thread grop you just have to right click on selected thread group and select disable option.
