1.Runtime controller:
   It will control the execution of its samplers/request for the given time
2.Create run time controller and place existing controller like Booking flight controller and give the time as 20 seconds then this particular sampler will execute until 20 seconds
  completed.
3.That means we are putting load on particular sampler continously.

Note : 
  In real time scenario, sometimes only some module is breaking lets say in airlines booking only reservation sampler getting failed on some times like black fridays or deals day
  so our concentration is to observer more and more on particular sampler so we keep on load for particualr module at some point of time

4.Random order controller :
  Random order controller is same as interleave controller but it wont follow any order like top to bottom.
5.Random order controller picks only one sampler/controller at a time but it wont follow any order, may be for the first run it may take 10th controller and for second 
  iteration it may take 100th controller/sampler and so on..!
6.Random controller will pick only one sampler/controller for execution randomly.
