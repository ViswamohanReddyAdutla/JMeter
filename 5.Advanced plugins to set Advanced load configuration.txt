1.As of now we know how to put load on the server like number of users to run and Ramp-up time like that.
2.if we want to put advanced load in servers we need to import few more plugins into jmeter tool, follow below process
  a) Download jar from the below url.
       https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/
           or 
  b) just go to google and search for "jmeter plugins", you can get number of plugins.you can download based on your requirment.
  c) Instead of this i can download plugin manager uing above mentioned url, by which we can install any plugin in the tool itself.
  d) After installing of the plugin manager go to jmeter options there you can see option called plugin manager here i didnt installed yet
     hence i am not able to see plugin manager option.
  e) once you have downloaded JAR you have to put that jar file into Jmeter lib/ext directory and then restart Jmeter.
  f) After that go to options and then you are able to see Plugin Manager option.
  g) Now click on Plugin Manager then you can see three tabs like, installed plugins, available plugins, upgrades
      installed plugins -> which are already installed in your machine
      Available plugins -> which are ready to install in your machines
      updates -> as we know updates for installed one
  f) Here i am going to install one plugin called custom thread groups which has different types of thread groups,
     we just click on check box particular plgin and click on apply changes and restart jmeter, So it will automatically restart the jmeter 
     if not you can do it manually then you can see the changes. 
  g) once your trying to create a thread group by navigating Right click on Test Plan -> Add -> Threads(Users) -> Then you can see
     customized thread groups.You can chosee what you want and write your test script under this plugin.
  h) Now i am creating concurrency thread group here.
