2.If we want to see only controller resulst then select on the controller and click on Generate parent sample.
3.Transaction controllers help us to generate statics for each and every sample/each and every controller
4.Simple controller is also helps to group required steps into respective controller and also it wont generate report in controller level. instead it will generate report in steps level.
5.The only advantage of simple controller is we can able to seperate each steps in seperate folder thats it nothing more than this.so if you want to track performance in transaction
  level then you must go with transaction level controller.
6.Lets say if your trying to execute same code again and again then you need to create the test script for same again and again right, to avoid that module controllers comes 
  into the picture.
7.Module controller:
   How to create module controller
