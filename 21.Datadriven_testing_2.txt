1.Under this thread we need to create CSV Data set config file and need to pass data in that file and then pass the csv data file details over there.
   Right click on thread group -> Add -> Config Elements -> CSV Data set config

2.Now need to pass below fields in csv data set config 

3.Under configure the CSV data source.
  select Filename with path : D:\Personal\JMeter\data.csv
  select variable Names (comma-delimited): first,last,email   (All column names)
    in csv file i have stored firstname,lastname and email fields like above format.
  Delimiter(use '\t' for tab) : ,   (In csv file i have seperated all values in comma so i have passed delimiter)

4.Lets say, If we pass 10 users data in file and we try to hit 100 users then the first 10 therads will pick up data after that remaining
  90 threads we don't have data right so if we pass Recycle on EOF = True then again it will start from zeroth data.

5.If we pass Stop Thread on EOF as True then after completing data then it wont start from the user.

6.Here we have passed user,email and password so i am treating these values as variables and will pass these variables inside of the sampler like below.
  ${User}
  ${email}
  ${pwd}
 Then it will fetch all these values from the data.csv files.

7.Now just run the script by passing number of threads you want to hit.then your job will done for data driven testing.
