1.Lets say if your working on real time application you dont take input data is same for all time right.
2.Interleave is a type of controllers, it will execute only one sampler/controller at a time.
3.Lets say if we have 10 steps under interleave controller and when we run the script for first run first step will pickup
4.For second run, second data will pick up this process will continue until all the steps completed.
5.execution order of the interleave controller is from top to down.
6.We can pass test steps/existing controller inside of the interleave controllers

Note :
 In real time scenarios, when we try to book a flight each user will select different city's so we can write test script for different combinations of data and wrap it into the controller
 and then will pass all those controllers inside of the interleave controller so that each time one controller will execute means each user will try to access application with diffferent
 data
