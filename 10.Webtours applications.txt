1.To perform load testing we need websites same like real time applications
2.If we try to do it in random applications, it may impact their business and also some websites will block you if users are getting increased
3.To avoid that will use any of the below applications.
  a) https://blazedemo.com/
  b) https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
  c) https://marketplace.microfocus.com/appdelivery/content/web-tours-sample-application
    webtours application was developed by hp for load testing practise but we need to download this app and run it in the local server then
    we can paly with it.
      1. Go to above url and click on download
      2. After successful download you can see two files one is zip file and other is executable file called as straberry-perl-version
      3.Extract the zip file and click on executable so that it will install it in your machine
      4.After suuccessful installation need to open application folder where we can one bat file named as StartServer.bat just double 
        click it, then application will up and run on local server
      5.To stop the server just press control C in command prompt or close cmd directly.
      6.Now we need url for that application to create the scripts right, for that navigate to config folder under webtours application
      7.you can see httpd.conf file and you can open that file in notepad
      8.Search for listen and then you can find port number on which port application is running by default port number is 8080, so go to 
        browser and use below url to open application in browser.
          localhost:8080/webTours/home.html -> then we can see the application
 
Note : I am not intrested to install this application currently so i will run my next scripts on blazedemo.com
